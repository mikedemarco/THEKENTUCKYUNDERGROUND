# THEKENTUCKYUNDERGROUND
THEKENTUCKYUNDERGROUND
Project: In a climate of high fuel costs, lack of mass public transportation, and congested highway system The Kentucky Underground seeks to elevate the issues. The Kentucky Underground, will be a futuristic application coded in C# that will allow customers to purchase tickets and view direct hypothetical tunnel routes that are burrowed under the Earth’s surface within the state of Kentucky. The Kentucky Underground will be implemented on Microsoft’s Visual Studio and will utilize Visual Studio’s built-in command console.

The project will include the following features:

1) The Kentucky Underground project will implement a “master loop” console application with quit option.
2) The Kentucky Underground project will calculate and display data based on an external factor (The "New Routes coming soon" feature within the main menu will get the current date, and display how many days remaining until the new tunnel routes are open).
3) The Kentucky Underground will have a conversion tool that converts another input to another type and displays it. (Users will be able to convert US Dollars into Euro's).

The application will work on: Linux, macOS and Windows as well.
