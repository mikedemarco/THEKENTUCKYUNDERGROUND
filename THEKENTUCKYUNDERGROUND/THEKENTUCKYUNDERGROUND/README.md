# THEKENTUCKYUNDERGROUND
THEKENTUCKYUNDERGROUND
Project: In a climate of alarming energy costs, lack of mass public transportation, and congested highway system The Kentucky Underground seeks to elevate the issues. The Kentucky Underground, is a futuristic application coded in C# that allows customers to purchase tickets for pickup and view direct hypothetical tunnel routes that are burrowed under the Earth’s surface within the state of Kentucky.  The Kentucky Underground will be implemented on Microsoft’s Visual Studio and will utilize Visual Studio’s built-in command console. Michael De Marco will be the student coding The Kentucky Underground.

The project will include the following features:

1)	Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in my program
2)	Add comments to your code explaining how you are using at least 2 of the solid principles.
3)	Make a generic class and use it.
4)	Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format. 



The application will work on: Linux, macOS and Windows as well.
