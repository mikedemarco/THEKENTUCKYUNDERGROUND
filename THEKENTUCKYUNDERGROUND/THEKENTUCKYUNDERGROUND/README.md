# THEKENTUCKYUNDERGROUND
THEKENTUCKYUNDERGROUND
Project: In a climate of high fuel costs, lack of mass public transportation, and congested highway system The Kentucky Underground seeks to elevate the issues. The Kentucky Underground, will be a futuristic application coded in C# that will allow customers to purchase tickets and view direct hypothetical tunnel routes that are burrowed under the Earth’s surface within the state of Kentucky. The Kentucky Underground will be implemented on Microsoft’s Visual Studio and will utilize Visual Studio’s built-in command console.

The project will include the following features:
1)  Implementing a “master loop” console application
2)	A list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in my program
3)	Build a conversion tool that converts under input to another type and displays it
4)	Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)

The application will work on: Linux, macOS and Windows as well.
